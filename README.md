### • *Christmas project:* [Advent of Code](https://github.com/lpun-majessica/advent-of-code)

As :sparkles::christmas_tree: Christmas :christmas_tree::sparkles: is just around the corner, I want to join in with everyone to countdown until the holidays by challenging myself to solve these puzzles to the best of my ability.
:sparkles::christmas_tree: ***Merry Christmas*** :christmas_tree::sparkles: everyone! :D

### • *Project 1:* [Data Cleaning in SQL with Taylor Swift Spotify dataset](https://github.com/lpun-majessica/DataAnalyticsPortfolio/blob/main/SQL/data_cleaning_taylor_swift.ipynb)

<div id="banner" align="center">
  <img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-03/18/20/asset/4384748fe195/sub-buzz-14447-1679170744-1.jpg" width="350"/>
</div>

This is my very first project trying to clean [this Taylor Swift Spotify Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jarredpriester/taylor-swift-spotify-dataset) on Kaggle. I decided to do this to help apply what I've learned from the 4th course of the Google Data Analytics Certificate Program about data cleaning and reinforce this newly acquired knowledge.

### • *Project 2:* [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in SQL with Animal Shelter Analytics dataset](https://github.com/lpun-majessica/DataAnalyticsPortfolio/blob/main/SQL/eda_animal_shelter.ipynb)

<div id="banner" align="center">

</div>

This is my second project and I challenged myself to do an EDA on [this Animal Shelter Analytics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackdaoud/animal-shelter-analytics) on Kaggle. After finishing Course 5 of the Google Data Analytics Certificate Program, I felt like I learned enough to tackle an EDA on my own *(with the help of the Internet)*. And since I had so many questions after looking at this dataset, why wouldn't I start with it?

### • *Project 3:* [Data Visualization of Vietnam National High School Graduation Exam (NHGE) Results 2022](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lpun.majessica/viz/TableauProjectVietnamNHSE2022/ResultReport)

<div id="banner" align="center">

</div>

My first Tableau project after finishing the 6th Course of the Google Data Analytics Certificate Program. As the NHGE 2023 has just ended, I thought that I could do something related to this event while exploring and practicing making a dashboard in Tableau.
